# Hyrule Compendium

Hello there! This is a demo project demonstrating my ability to call a freely available web API and display the results in a meaningful and creative way. You can view the [live deployment here](https://asproson.github.io/hyrule-compendium/).

This repo makes use of the *Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* [Hyrule Compendium API](https://gadhagod.github.io/Hyrule-Compendium-API/#/), which lists numerous monsters and items within the game.

## Concept

When playing *Breath of the Wild* you eventually obtain a [Sheikah slate](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Sheikah_Slate), which is a Hyrulian version of a tablet/smartphone. When using this device you can view things such as a world map or recipe catalogue, but it also contains a beastiary that details an individual monster's locations, strengths/weaknesses, and potential items they might drop when defeated. 

Following from this idea I decided to make use of the Hyrule Compendium API and turn that data into an interactive web version of the Sheikah slate. In this project I used:

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Axios
- Jest
- React Icons
- GitHub Pages
