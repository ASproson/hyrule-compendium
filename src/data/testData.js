They're much more dangerous than the Bokoblins. In fact, Moblins have been known to pick up Bokoblins and throw them as makeshift projectile weapons.",

Their ability to breathe fire makes White-Maned Lynels among the toughest of the species; each one of their attacks is an invitation to the grave. There are so few eyewitness accounts of this breed because a White-Maned Lynel is not one to let even simple passersby escape with their lives.",

They're a crafty bunch, sometimes disguising themselves as simple travelers or villagers to get the jump on you. Be wary of suspicious people you encounter. They're very agile and carry a bow and one-handed sword.",
